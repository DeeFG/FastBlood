# Fast Blood  :hospital:
## Client-side tracking mechanism for rare or type specific blood products
##Problem
####Some people in the patient care chain may have limited understanding of the difficulties in finding rare units of blood, particularly in clinically urgent situations. This app is to help the understanding and communication between blood providers, transfusion laboratories, clinicians, and patients.

## My Solution :hammer_and_wrench: 
#### A plugin application that predicts the amount of time to recieve antigen typed blood. This plug in displays the progresss so medical staff can view the application independently from any client-side workbench.
